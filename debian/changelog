  * Fix replaces for dpkg-dev
  * Add gettext-support to dselect
  * Added Czech and Polish translations for dpkg
  * Fixed incorrect patch for --print-architecture (oops, oh well
    it was already broken when there was no gcc anyway :)
  * Fixed missing mipseb that was supposed to be in the archtable
  * Better output in update-alternatives --config, now shows the
    current, and the prefered choices.
  * dpkg-name: ignore epoch when getting version
  * 50dpkg-dev.el: add it as a conffile for dpkg-dev
  * internals.sgml: Removed references to the versions of build tools,
    they date the document.
  * debian-changelog-mode.el: added hint for better log-email handling
  * Added recognition for new source-depends fields for policy
    referenced in bug #41232
  * dpkg-buildpackage: add -ap option to force a pause prior to starting
    the sign process. This helps for people who don't keep their signatures
    on the filesystem (on a floppy perhaps, then mount as needed).
  * minor script corrections
  * dpkg-dev control: Change gcc to c-compiler in the recommends field, and
    move cpio, patch and make to the depends line
  * Leave file info intact in available when installing packages. MD5sum,
    Filename, and MSDOS-Filename used to get lost when installing a
    package.
  * Added armv4l to archtable
  * Added 'D' to the list of choices for conffile handling, closes: #48137
  * Converted internals.sgml to debiandoc format. Also added a dpkg-doc
    package that contains the generated output from this file (.ps, .html
    and .info), includes doc-base support. Internals.sgml is also not
    generated on the binary-arch target, and is no longer "byhand"
  * dpkg-gencontrol: add "Source" to the fields placed in the control file
  * dpkg-parsechangelog: fixed loop for parsepath (#48526)
  * main/{processarc.c,depcon.c}: added new structure for conflictors,
    which contains a struct for conflicts. This is used to create an array
    of conflicting packages, which are going to be replaced. Allows for
    multiple conflicts and replaces. All conflictor handlers were
    converted to loops to handle each one (processarc.c).
  * dpkg-divert: Fix check for writable filesystem, closes: #48646

  * Backout dep check patch

 -- Ben Collins <bcollins@debian.org>  Sat, 23 Oct 1999 00:39:24 -0400

dpkg (1.4.1.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add support for long filenames, along with --assert-longfilenames
  * Added --chuid option to start-stop-daemon to allow switching to
    a different uid when starting a process
  * Add mipseb and mipsel to the archtable too, since mips and mipseb are
    both viable names for the mips big endian arch, and mipsel is also needed
  * Update dpkg-architecure's archtable
  * Added --config option to update-alternatives to allow easy changing
    of the registered alternatives for a specific name
  * Updated the deb-control(5) man page with all the current fields
    and uses
  * Made the large info screen show 5 lines of the pkglist so that
    it scrolled properly, and still showed the cursor in dselect
  * Removed references to dpkg(5) which seems to not exist anymore
  * Fixed `dpkg-deb --help' and dpkg-deb(1) from reporting --no-check
    when it's actually --nocheck (went with the hardcoded option, so
    this is just a documentation fix).
  * Added better check in disk.setup for a working NFS server. Makes
    it compatible with other non-Linux servers.
  * Corrected dpkg(8)'s example of using dpkg -i (showed it used with
    a .tar.gz instead of a .deb)
  * Applied patch to correct improper TMPDIR handling in dpkg-deb
  * When encountering an error in extracting the tar archives in the
    packages, we should abort the install, not simply give an error
    and continue.
  * Make dpkg give the builtin arch if there was an error while exec()'ing
    the C compiler with --print-architecture. We still fail if the
    output from gcc was bad in some way, since they may be of importance.
  * Removed the maintainer-configure portion in debian/rules, since
    we should be shipping the source with all the auto* stuff
    already generated anyway
  * Removed the ltconfig patch, and resort to a debian/rules fix
    to libtool itself after running configure
  * Removed shlibs.default.i386. It's now a template for arch porting to
    Debian/dpkg, we install it still, if there exists a file matching the
    arch
  * Reimplemented a better *stat cache for the removal checking code,
    this helps a lot when doing upgrades where the packages are a lot
    different in layout
  * Increased largemem auto detection to >= 24megs, since it's not uncommon
    for dpkg to actually use 16megs of ram all on its own when using the
    largemem setting (old minimum was 16megs)
  * debian/rules: chmod -x everything in /usr/lib to make lintian happy.
    in the clean phase just rm -rf $(BUILD), we don't need to run
    distclean and all that other stuff. Don't run "make dist", we
    simply copy the .tar.gz that dpkg-source creates for the byhand
    source.
  * Make start-stop-daemon exit(1) when we don't find one of the
    pid's we are trying to kill, in accordance with the man page.
  * When running --configure on an already installed package, just
    say it's installed, and not that it is in an unconfigurable
    state
  * Fixed some compiler warnings
  * Make dpkg check for uid 0 requirement, before checking the path
    since not being root, is probably the reason that the PATH is
    borked in the first place
  * Make -p short for --print-avail, and -P short for --purge
  * Fix typo in md5sum(1) man page
  * start-stop-daemon: Add --background and --make-pidfile options
  * update-alternatives: make sure we remove "old" symlinks when they
    are no longer pertinent. Add /etc/alternatives/README that refers
    to the update-alternatives(8) man page.
  * dpkg-divert: Add check for being able to write to the old/new
    destination before doing a rename. We fail on this, without
    changing the diversion registry
  * Fix bad regex in update-rc.d

dpkg (1.4.1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modify tarobject() so it does not complain if we are creating a

dpkg (1.4.0.30) unstable; urgency=low

  * dpkg-dev isn't allowed to have a Recommends: debian-keyring (as that's
    in contrib), so it's now lowered to a Suggests: . Thanks to James Troup

dpkg (1.4.0.28) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added gpg (GNU Privacy Guard) support:
    * scripts/buildpackage.sh: default to GPG (unless no GPG, but only a PGP
      secret key file is found), as GPG, unlike PGP, is DFSG-free.
    * Updated dpkg-source(1), and added gpg(1) and pgp(1) to the SEE ALSO
      section.
    * Worked around broken textmode implementation in GPG.

  * No longer includes developer-keys.pgp . Instead, dpkg now Suggests: and
    dpkg-dev now Recommends: developer-keyring.
  * Compiled with latest libstdc++ (2.9).

 -- Daniel Jacobowitz <dan@debian.org>  Thu, 23 Jul 1998 12:02:04 -0400

dpkg (1.4.0.25) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  
  * Add the requested -nc option to dpkg-buildpackage (Do
    not clean source tree, useful in debugging cycles).
  * controllib.pl: Again by popular acclamation, fix the getlogin() warnings.
    I redirected STDERR onto fd 0 before calling getlogin().
  * tools.m4: Fix display of whether c++ works.
  * dpkg-deb/extract.c: glibc 2.1 and some kernels want to make
    fflush() move the current fpos.  Until someone can fix that,
    protect with seek.
  * Add an extra 0, to dselect/{pkg,meth}keys.cc so it compiles again.
  * Start using lchown() if available.
  * Really fix #20353. (aclocal.m4 was the wrong place; that's a generated
    file.  The correct place is in tl_canon.m4.)

  * scripts/dpkg-genchanges.pl: applied patch from Roman Hodek

  * aclocal.m4: applied patch from Joel Klecker <jk@espy.org> to handle
    egcs' --print-libgcc-file-name output. [#20353]
  
  * debian/copyright: correct FSF address.
  * debian/rules: add code from lesstif's debian/rules to make libtool
    less of a fool (i.e. not use -rpath and to link shared libraries
    against libraries it depends on).  Code by Richard Braakman
    <dark@xs4all.nl> and Yann Dirson <dirson@debian.org>.
  * debian/rules: remove all reference to the packaging manual as it is
    now provided by the seperate "packaging-manual" package. [#21581,
    #21186, #22698, #23342]
  * debian/rules: link dpkg-divert.1.gz to undocumented.7.gz as the lack
    of a real manpage has been reported in #11093.
  * debian/README.compile: removed gawk and bogus comment about gettext
    being in experimental, as reported by Santiago Vila <sanvila@unex.es>

    better and more standard than the previous way, but I'd welcome
    opinions to the contrary.  Consider this a 'probationary' change for

dpkg (1.4.0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Check fputs() return values for (ret >= 0), not (ret != 0) (fixes #7522).

    binaries (fixes #4988).
  * Change 'details of the old format' to 'details of the new format' in
    deb-old.5 (fixes #7605).
  * dpkg-source -b now warns (was previously silent) if maintainer changes
    create new subdirectories.  dpkg-source -x now warns (previously gave
    error) if maintainer changes create new subdirectories (partially
    fixes #6866, #6671, #5045, #6482).    
  * Added manual page for start-stop-daemon (8).

    <tom@lpsg.demon.co.uk>.<

    segregating and defining the interface).

    have been converted so far.  No translations have yet been
    constructed.

    ldd (fixes #7603, #7926, #8688, #9179, #9134, #8516).

    dpkg-buildpackage to choose PGP key based on Maintainer: field of 
    package being built (or -m<maintainer> option, if present) (fixes 
    #7898).
  * Changed controllib.pl to use $ENV{LOGNAME}, getlogin(), and $<
    (in that order) to determine the intended ownership of 
    debian/{files,substvars},  (fixes #7324, #6823, #5659, #5965, #5929,
    #9239, #5366).
  * Don't sign .dsc file in dpkg-buildpackage if building a binary-only
    release (fixes #7260).
  * Updated developer-keys.pgp to latest revision (fixes #6134).

    a separate flag.
  * Epochs in version numbers implemented, using the syntax
    <epoch>:<version>-<revision>.  (Epoch not usually displayed.)

  * Fixed missing space in version syntax error messages.
  * Manpage dpkg.8 installed with warning about inaccuracy.

 -- Ian Jackson <iwj10@cus.cam.ac.uk>  Fri, 4 Aug 1995 01:39:52 +0100

dpkg (0.93.66) ALPHA; priority=MEDIUM

  * dpkg will correctly remove overwritten files from the lists of
    the package(s) that used to contain them.

  * dpkg --purge is now an action, rather than a modifier for --remove,
    and the -P alias for it is withdrawn.

  * dpkg --unpack/--install filenames in messages are now more sensible
    about when to use .../ (show as many trailing components as possible
    in 40 characters, or the whole path if that the last component is
    longer than that).

 -- Ian Jackson <iwj10@cus.cam.ac.uk>  Thu, 3 Aug 1995 02:11:03 +0100

dpkg (0.93.65) ALPHA; priority=MEDIUM

  * dpkg --remove should, when a package being removed is depended-on
    by another that is also queued for removal, defer the depended-on
    package rather than aborting it.  (Bug#1188.)

  * dpkg will not attempt to configure or remove a package more than
    once in the same run.  (Bug#1169.)

  * dpkg cosmetic fix to dependency problems message (this bug
    hasn't been triggered to my knowledge).

  * perl-dpkg no longer installed in /usr/bin.

 -- Ian Jackson <iwj10@cus.cam.ac.uk>  Wed, 2 Aug 1995 13:02:58 +0100

dpkg (0.93.64) ALPHA; priority=MEDIUM

  * dpkg marks a package as no longer `to be configured in this run'
    when an error occurs, so that other packages which depend on it
    will fail (rather than causing a loop and an assertion failure,
     packages.c:166: failed assertion `dependtry <= 4').

  * dselect initial selection granularity is single-package.
  * dpkg --no-also-select option renamed to --selected-only (old option
    still accepted, but no longer in --help).  Changed -N to -O.

  * dselect `update' option changed to `install' (and other options
    renamed too).  NB: old access methods will not work, because
    the `update' script should now be an `install' script.

  * dselect `installation methods' renamed to `access methods'.
  * dpkg --skip-same-version and --refuse-downgrade produce friendlier
    messages when they skip packages.
  * --licence option now properly mentioned in all programs' --version
    messages.

  * bad fix for ELF compile problem involving myopt.h removed (compile
    problem turned out to be a GCC bug.)

 -- Ian Jackson <iwj10@cus.cam.ac.uk>  Tue, 1 Aug 1995 03:03:58 +0100

dpkg (0.93.63) ALPHA; priority=LOW

  * preinst works around shell bug/misfeature involving `trap'.

  * dpkg --skip-same-version doesn't skip packages which have
    an error flag set or which aren't in a standard `installed' state.

  * dpkg --search now does a substring search if the string doesn't
    start with a wildcard character (*, [ or ?) or slash.

  * problem with C/C++ linkage of stuff in "myopt.h" fixed, to help
    with compiling with GCC 2.7.0.

  * dselect Makefile.in `clean' deletes curkeys.inc &c, so that they are
    not shipped in the distribution source and will be rebuilt on the
    target system.

 -- Ian Jackson <iwj10@cus.cam.ac.uk>  Thu, 27 Jul 1995 13:38:47 +0100

dpkg (0.93.62) ALPHA; priority=HIGH

  * dpkg purges leftover control scripts from /var/lib/dpkg/tmp.ci,
    rather than associating them with the wrong package.  (Bug#1101.)

  * dpkg won't `disappear' packages containing no files or directories,
    nor a package required for depends/recommended.  (Bug#1128.)

  * dpkg follows directory symlinks.  (Bug#1125.)

  * dselect fixups for ELF/GCC2.7.0 compilation.

 -- Ian Jackson <iwj10@cus.cam.ac.uk>  Fri, 21 Jul 1995 21:43:41 +0100

  * dpkg implements `disappear' functionality.
  * dpkg/dselect remove dead entries from /var/lib/dpkg/status.

    encountered in the `available' file so far.

 -- Ian Jackson <iwj10@cus.cam.ac.uk>  Fri, 14 Jul 1995 20:19:21 +0100

dpkg (0.93.57) ALPHA; priority=LOW

  * dpkg does chroot when running maintainer scripts (--instdir
    should work right now, though I haven't been able to test it).

 -- Ian Jackson <iwj10@cus.cam.ac.uk>  Fri, 14 Jul 1995 01:32:30 +0100

dpkg (0.93.56) ALPHA; priority=HIGH

dpkg (0.93.54) ALPHA; priority=MEDIUM

  * dpkg and dselect no longer throw away all Class and Section
    information in /var/lib/dpkg/available.  (Oops.)
  * dpkg --refuse-<something> now works (this broke some dselect
    method scripts' attempts to use --refuse-downgrade).
  * dpkg --audit and --list implemented.

 -- Ian Jackson <iwj10@cus.cam.ac.uk>  Mon, 10 Jul 1995 00:35:13 +0100

      and unpack packages;
    - invoke dpkg to configure and remove packages.
    There are no installation methods available yet.

  * Search feature in dselect works (it was purely an ncurses bug).

  * dpkg-*.nondebbin.tar.gz now available (built by debian.rules).

  * The target directory for dpkg-deb --extract (also available as
    dpkg --extract) is no longer optional.  dpkg-deb suggests the use

 -- Ian Jackson <iwj10@cus.cam.ac.uk>  Sun, 14 May 1995 18:05:38 +0100

dpkg (0.93.38) BETA; priority=MEDIUM

    for `package_revision' and writes the former.

  * Major improvements and many changes to C option parsing, database
    management, error handling, Makefiles &c to support dpkg.
  * dpkg-deb should now work if sizeof(void*) < sizeof(void(*)()).

 -- Ian Jackson <iwj10@cus.cam.ac.uk>  Mon, 24 Apr 1995 12:34:39 +0100

    as the predefined ones which we understand and can interpret).
  * Fixed bug that prevented display update when moving down a small
    recursive package list in dselect.
  * Column heading characters corrected from `SHOC' to `HSOC'.

 * Better algorithm for scrolling up/down when moving highlight.
 * Fixed bug in display of `preformatted' extended Description lines.

Mon, 27 Mar 1995 03:30:51 BST  Ian Jackson <iwj10@cus.cam.ac.uk>

	* dpkg (0.93.32): Alpha dselect released and installed in
	                  /usr/sbin/dselect.
	* dpkg (0.93.32): Many portability enhancements: should now
	                  compile using GCC 2.6.3, and dpkg-deb should
	                  compile better on non-Linux systems.

	                  just for input buffers.
	* dpkg (0.93.32): varbuf has C++ member functions in header
	                  #ifdef __cplusplus.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.31:

* start-stop-daemon --pidfile now works (Bug#571).
* Fixed dependency processing bugs which could require a rerun of
  dpkg --configure (Bug#566).

* Made postinst scripts really be run when dpkg --purge used.
* Added new --force-extractfail option - VERY DANGEROUS.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.28:

* Make version number specifications in Depends &c work.
* Added AC_PROG_CXX to autoconf.in for dselect.
* Changed myopt.h not to have cipaction field in cmdinfo (this was
  specially for dpkg-deb) - now we have a generic void*.

* Much work in `dselect' subdirectory.
* Deleted executables, objects and libraries from OLD tree !
* Minor changes to various copyright notices and top-of-file comments.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.25:

* Fixed duplicate output (failure to flush before fork) bug.
* More clarification of md5sum.c copyright.
* Corrected typo in ChangeLog in 0.93.24 source package.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.24:

* dpkg could copy conffiles info from one package to another.  Aargh.
  Bug #426.
* dpkg failed to initialise status if you tried to remove or
  configure a nonexistent package.  Bug #419.
* install-info now handles START-INFO-DIR-ENTRY entries like:
   * Gdb::                         The GNU debugger.
  Previously it would only accept (Bug #407):
   * Gdb: (gdb).                   The GNU debugger.

   * Foo: (foo.info).              The Gnoo Foo.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.23:

* `dpkg-deb' --build now does a syntax check on the control file.
* `dselect' is now no longer called `debian', spurious copy removed
  from package top-level source directory.
* C control information parsing complete and somewhat tested.
* Moved `global' include files into $(srcdir)/include from ../lib,
  added some files to the lib Makefile, and arranged for pop_cleanup().

Changes in dpkg 0.93.22:

* Fixed bug which caused dpkg to see failures of md5sum where there
  were none (would also have caused dpkg to miss a real failure).
* Fixed failure to update some `status' database fields.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.21:

* Fixed error-handling bug which could corrupt database.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.20:

* Fixed bug which ran old (/var/adm/dpkg) postinst scripts.
* Fixed dpkg usage message which claimed -i => both --install & --info.
* Use Colin Plumb's MD5 code - faster, and better copyright.
* Manpages: dpkg-deb(8), deb-control(5), deb(5) - thanks to Raul
  Deluth Miller.  Also, an xfig picture of some C program innards.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.19:

* Don't delete the `list' file from the dpkg database.
* Fixed various bugs in the conffile handling.
* Conffiles that are symlinks will now be treated as if the
  `dereferenced' name of the file was listed in conffiles.  This means
  that /etc/foo -> /usr/etc/foo will cause all conffile updates of
  /etc/foo to create /usr/etc/foo.dpkg-tmp &c instead.  However, the
  link will be removed if --purge is used to delete all the conffiles.
* When doing a new installation, or when updating a conffile that
  wasn't listed as a conffile in the old version of the package, don't
  do any prompting but just install the version from the archive.
* Corrected error message if exec of dpkg --vextract failed
  and --instroot or --root specified.

  not specified.
* Create /var/lib/dpkg/updates.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.17:

* install-info --remove exits with status 0 if it doesn't find the
  thing to remove, instead of status 1.
* Error handling functions have __attribute__((format...)) if GCC.
* push_cleanup its arg takes void **argv instead of char **argv.
* Top-level Makefile.in has set -e before `for' loops.
* dpkg-deb --info not-an-existing-file produces fewer error messages.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.16:

* Made --root= option really extract to $instroot instead of `/'.
* install-info clears the 0444 bits in its umask.
* Fixed a few database handling bugs which cause dpkg always to fail,
  and usually to corrupt the status database in various ways.
* dpkg-deb completely rewritten, now doesn't tinker with
  /var/{adm,lib}/dpkg.  Should be faster.
* Directory structure and Makefiles in source package reorganised.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.15:

* Added `debian' (dselect), still very primitive.
* Database format changed, and moved from /var/adm to /var/lib.
* Added dpkg --avail mode, --list, --status and --search.
* Set of dpkg => dpkg-deb pass-through operations changed (but
  dpkg-deb not yet updated).
* Added --root, --admindir and --instdir, as well as --isok &c.
* Moved much stuff into /usr/lib/dpkg-lib.pl, rewritten status
  database handling.
* Put packages in `purge' state even if `deinstall' requested if
  they have no postrm and no conffiles.
* Version number comparisons fixed.
* insert-version.pl now installes lib.pl filename too.
* Strip trailing slashes when reading files from file lists.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.14:

* Fixed parsing of DEPENDS &c fields with trailing whitespace.
* postinst now fixes up broken ispell.control file.
* Cyclic dependency/multiple package removal processing: don't consider
  packages we've just removed when looking for a reason not to go ahead.
* Added call to postinst with `purge' argument for expunging old
  configuration etc. that aren't listed in conffiles.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.13:

* sub S_ISREG defined in dpkg.pl.
* Checking of DEPENDS &c fields was too lax, causing an internal error
  if you fed it certain kinds of broken control file.
* Fixed misleading message from bogus installationstatus call.
* New -u and -U options to dpkg-deb which don't unpack the /DEBIAN
  directory, and use these in dpkg.pl; clean up /DEBIAN in postinst.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.12:

* No longer needs *.ph files, since these appear to be broken.
* Postinst fixes up *.control files with curly brackets.
* embryo of dselect.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.11:

* New --ignore-depends option.
* This ChangeLog changed format here.

	* more debugging around conffiles updates.

	* *.hash files not deleted so soon.

	* adds brand new packages to status array so we can install them.

Mon Nov 28 02:00:13 GMT 1994  Ian Jackson  <iwj10@cus.cam.ac.uk>

        * dpkg 0.93.10 released.

        * dpkg.pl completely rewritten.

        * dpkg-deb: removed dabase-processing and --install option.

        * Makefiles reworked, debian.rules added.

        * Don't install anything in /usr/doc/examples.

        * dpkg-*.deb contains /usr/bin/dpkg-deb.dist, fixed up by postinst.

Thu Oct 20 13:22:20 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)

        * dpkg 0.93.9 released.

        * dpkg.pl: Use $argument, not $package, with `--build'.
        Make sure that saved postinst scripts are executable.

Tue Oct 18 09:40:57 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)

        * dpkg 0.93.8 released.

        * deb/remove.c (pkg_remove): Do not report an error from rmdir ()
        when `errno' is ENOTEMPTY (Directory not empty), because in this
        case we have found the highest-level directory in the package and
        are ready to exit the loop (i.e., it is a normal occurrence).

Mon Oct 17 10:44:32 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)

        * Makefile.in: Adapted all Makefiles to the GNU Coding Standards.

        * deb/remove.c (pkg_remove): Make sure that parent directories are
        removed LAST!  This will result in complete removal of packages
        when --remove is called.  dpkg 0.93.7 (and earlier) had problems
        with this because it tried to remove directories in order, which
        will work most of the time, but not necessarily all of the time.

        * deb/list.c (pkg_list): Output is sorted by package name.

Tue Oct  4 12:27:10 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)

        * deb/contents.c (pkg_contents): When a list file cannot be
        opened, silently fail and let the front-end explain the problem.

        * deb/util.c (return_info): When a control file cannot be opened,
        silently fail and let the front-end explain the problem.

        * deb/search.c (pkg_search): Exit 0 if the regular expression is
        matched and 1 if it is not.

Mon Oct  3 18:38:53 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)

        * dpkg.pl: New file.  Replaces dpkg.sh.

        * deb/Makefile.in: Renamed `dpkg-util.deb' to `dpkg-deb'.

        * deb/build.c (pkg_build): `--build' is less verbose, instead
        letting the front-end add verbosity where appropriate.

        * deb/install.c (pkg_install): Ditto.

        * deb/remove.c (pkg_remove): Ditto.

        * deb/search.c (pkg_search): Ditto.

        * deb/describe.c (pkg_describe): `--describe' is less verbose,
        instead letting the front-end add verbosity where appropriate.
        The ``Description:'' label has been removed.

        * deb/version.c (pkg_version): `--version' is less verbose,
        instead letting the front-end add verbosity where appropriate.
        The ``Version:'' label has been removed, as has the maintainer
        information.

Mon Sep 12 14:22:04 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)

        * deb/version.c (pkg_version): `--version' now reports the
        version number of dpkg if no argument is specified.

Thu Sep  1 13:31:37 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)

        * dpkg 0.93.7 released.

        * deb/build.c (pkg_build): check status and exit if non-zero.

        * deb/contents.c (pkg_contents): ditto.

        * deb/install.c (archive_extract): ditto.

Thu Sep  1 13:20:08 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)

        * deb/version.c (pkg_version): indent to the same point as
        pkg_describe.

Thu Sep  1 12:21:11 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)

        * Makefile.in (dist): added debian.rules binary, source and
        dist targets to make final distribution easier to make.
        (install): install programs to /usr/bin.

        * deb/Makefile.in (install): install programs to /usr/bin.

        * deb/list.c (pkg_list): enforce a maximum limit of ten characters
        for the package name in the output.
        (pkg_list): left-justify the version number to make it easier for
        the front-end to parse the output.
        (pkg_list): replace first '\n' character in packages[n].description
        with '\0'.

        * deb/install.c (archive_extract): use the `p' option to `tar' to
        ensure that permissions are preserved.

Sat Aug 27 09:53:37 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)

        * dpkg 0.93.6 released.

        * deb/util.c (return_info): only unlink CONTROL if ARCHIVE_FLAG is
        true!

Fri Aug 26 15:38:22 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)

        * dpkg 0.93.5 released.

        * deb/contents.c (pkg_contents): merged function archive_contents
        into function pkg_contents.

        * deb/contents.c (pkg_contents): use lstat (rather than stat) so
        that symbolic links are recognized.
        (pkg_contents): print the usual `<path> -> <link_to>' now that we
        recognize symbolic links.

        * deb/util.c (return_info): create a FIFO to pipe the needed
        information to the ``formatter'' rather than creating a directory
        in /tmp for the package information, which is what we used to do.

Thu Aug 25 11:46:27 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)

        * lib/fake-ls.c (mk_date_string): return a pointer to malloc'ed
        area.
        (mk_mode_string): ditto.

        * dpkg.sh: make sure the control information is extracted to a
        uniquely-named temporary directory during package installation.

        * dpkg.sh: execute the pre- and post-removal scripts during
        package removal.

        * dpkg.sh: exit immediately if dpkg-util.deb reports failure.

        * deb/install.c (pkg_control): make sure that `package' exists and
        is a Debian archive before doing anything.

        * deb/install.c (pkg_extract): make sure that `package' exists and
        is a Debian archive before doing anything.

        * deb/install.c (pkg_install): unlink `extract_output' when done.

        * deb/remove.c (pkg_remove): use lstat (rather than stat) so that
        --remove does not get confused and think that a symbolic link to a
        directory is actually a directory, which results in the symbolic
        link never being removed at all.
