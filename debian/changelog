  * Add new dpkg-deb --deb-format option and base --new and --old on it,
    as the latter are not future-proof, and neither can be guaranteed to

  * Make sure the OpenGPG armor contains a signature block, even on EOF.
  * Do not accept Armor Header Lines inside a paragraph.
  * Do not abort dselect when multiarch is detected, as that only makes
    users downgrade and hold on an older version w/ worse multiarch support.

dpkg (1.16.9) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Raphaël Hertzog ]
  * Fix dpkg-source regression in "3.0 (quilt)" source packages while
    unapplying patches that remove all files in a directory. Closes: #683547
  * Fix segfault in field format parsing on empty strings, affecting
    «dpkg-query -W -f ''» and «dpkg-deb -W --showformat=''». LP: #1035512
  * Fix dpkg's French usage string which was missing the final “s“ in
    --print-foreign-architectures. Closes: #685863

  [ Guillem Jover ]
  * Use “statoverrides” instead of “statusoverrides” in dpkg-statoverride.
    Closes: #686995
  * Comment out dpkg(1) documentation about disabled --command-fd option.
    Closes: #685677
  * Cleanup dpkg-divert unit-test environment to avoid build failures.
    Closes: #687656
  * Fix update-alternatives test suite to behave correctly on non-Debian
    binary paths. Known to be affecting at least Gentoo and Mac OS X.
  * Do not leak subcall command arguments in update-alternatives.
  * Fix segfault on update-alternatives when passing --slave without any
    action at all. LP: #1037431
  * Fix memory leak in dpkg filesavespackage().
  * Do not print garbage (or worse) on dpkg shared conffile debug output.
  * Use a hash instead of a ref to a hash for keys() in Dpkg::BuildFlags
    get_feature_areas(). This causes compilation failures with older perl
    versions, which can be an issue with partial upgrades.
  * Fix filter subpattern debug output format string to print an actual
    value instead of just blanks.
  * Ignore trailing filter subpattern slashes on reinclusion comparison.
    This makes sure to reinclude directories previously excluded so that
    contained files marked for inclusion do not fail to unpack due to a
    missing directory. Closes: #688416
  * Do not consider obsolete conffiles as actively owned by the package.
    This ensures conffile entries are not mishandled nor mixed up when
    configuring packages owning the non-obsolete conffiles. Closes: #689836
    Based on a patch by Andreas Beckmann <debian@abeckmann.de>.
  * Properly mark in the database obsolete conffiles on package replaces.
  * Sync the Conffiles field values for all package instances. Because
    only the first package instance being configured will have a *.dpkg-new
    conffile available to be processed, the subsequent ones need to use the
    hash from the previously processed entries.
  * Fix logic for previously configured conffiles, so that the shared
    conffile checks actually work on reinstallation. Closes: #684776
  * Avoid info database corruption and bogus accesses on unknown format
    values, by always reading the format file and validating it.
  * Clarify that the most probable reason for multiarch database
    inconsistencies is due to upgrades from unofficial dpkg versions.
  * Only satisfy a dependency on a “Multi-Arch: foreign” if arch-unqualified.
  * Take architecture into account in virtual packages on remove and
    configure dpkg actions. Closes: #683411
  * Update update-alternatives --query format and examples in man page to
    match the implementation.
  * Add two missing 3rd person ‘s’ in dpkg-gensymbols(1). Closes: #689863
    Thanks to Paul Menzel <pm.debian@googlemail.com>.
  * Fix regression on old-style binNMUs for packages that specify an
    explicit binary version to dpkg-gencontrol, by always fixing up the
    source version. Closes: #690823

    Reported by Mats Erik Andersson <mats.andersson@gisladisker.se>.
  * Handle deb format versions as major.minor integers instead of strings or

dpkg (1.16.2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Guillem Jover ]
  * Move <config.h> and <compat.h> to the top of trigdeferred.l to properly
    use the configured features and compat code.
  * Honour --disable-nls when the system lacks obstack support, by updating
    the obstack compat module from gnulib.
  * Link the libdpkg unit tests with libcompat and libintl, so that systems
    needing them will compile correctly.
  * Check for the presence of the strnlen declaration and correctly provide
    the compat one in case the systems lacks it.
  * Do not assume existence of paths on the build system in the test suite.
  * Do not fail to link dselect on MacOS X when using --disable-nls.
  * Remove versioned coreutils Pre-Depends from dpkg due to the ancient
    md5sum transition. Reported by Bill Allombert <ballombe@debian.org>.
    Closes: #643746
  * Change dpkg-architecture to only compute the requested variables. This:
    - Fixes the bootstrapping problem, as the dpkg build system only needs
      the host architecture, for which dpkg itself is not required.
    - Reduces the amount of work performed, including loading and parsing
      unnecessary table files or calling either of gcc or dpkg programs.
  * Improve error message in dpkg-gencontrol and dpkg-gensymbols when
    debian/control does not have any package stanza. Closes: #642473
    Based on a patch by Kyle Willmon <kylewillmon@gmail.com>.
  * Add Pre-Depends on tar >= 1.23 (satisfied in stable) to dpkg due to it
    using the ‘--warning=no-timestamp’ option. Closes: #642802
  * Do not segfault on GNU/Linux when dpkg cannot retrieve the block size
    for the filesystem containing the info database. LP: #872734
  * Fix two memory leaks per tar entry in the tar extractor used on unpack.
  * Mark dpkg and dselect as Multi-Arch foreign.

    Thanks to Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>.
  * Add new deb-origin.5 man page. Closes: #608884
    Thanks to Matt Kraai <kraai@ftbfs.org>.
  * Return correct status on start-stop-daemon --status when using --pidfile.
  * Treat dpkg-deb compression level independently for each backend. This
    has the effect of changing the current behaviour for level 0 on all
    compressors except gzip.
  * Add new dpkg-deb -S option to specify the compression strategy. The only
    currently supported value is “extreme” for xz. Closes: #647915
  * Stop using brace expansion to install man pages by using dh_installman
    instead of dh_install, the former does not abort on empty glob expansion.
  * Do not use absolute paths for programs in perl and shell code.
  * Add missing ‘*’ in asprintf() and vasprintf() compat declarations.
  * Add support for virtual output binary:Summary and db:Status-Abbrev fields.
    Closes: #192619, #427945
  * Add support for virtual output source:Package and source:Version fields.
    Closes: #653575
  * Use a different temporary file per process on libcompat's vsnprintf()
    function to avoid race conditions from children after fork(3).
    Reported by Daniel Ruoso <daniel@ruoso.com>. Closes: #655411
  * Fix start-stop-daemon --exec and --name options on FreeBSD, NetBSD and
    OpenBSD by swapping the process matching implementations.
  * Fix start-stop-daemon --name option on GNU/Hurd to match the process name.
  * Document in more detail the implications of start-stop-daemon matching
    options. Closes: #367608
  * Improve and clarify dpkg-shlibdeps superfluous linking warning messages.
    Based on a patch by Peter Eisentraut <petere@debian.org>. Closes: #656496
  * Relax --merge-avail Packages file parser, to not fail on bogus versions.
  * When building only arch-indep binaries with «dpkg-buildpackage -A», name
    the .changes file using ‘all’ as architecture. Closes: #661638
  * Handle unknown architectures gracefully in dpkg-buildflags.
    Closes: #663004
  * Add missing --status-logger to dpkg --help output.
  * Do not print bogus errno string for invalid package names in dpkg
    --ignore-depends option.
  * Change dpkg-query to not load the available file by default for --list
    and --show, add a new --load-avail option to expose the old behaviour.
  * Only allow setting selections via «dpkg --set-selections» for known
    packages (i.e. those present in either the status or available files).
  * Always ignore older versions when parsing the available file, not only
    for --update-avail and --merge-avail.
  * Mark not-installed non-arch-qualified selections for removal.
  * Add new «dpkg --assert-multi-arch» command to allow checking for
    multi-arch support availability.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.3 (no changes needed).
  * Add architecture consistency checks to «dpkg --audit».
  * Add new dpkg --add-architecture and --remove-architecture commands to
    track supported architectures.

  [ Raphaël Hertzog ]
  * Update Dpkg::Shlibs to look into multiarch paths when cross-building
    too. Closes: #595144
  * Rewrite architecture.mk with explicit loops instead of duplicating many
    similar lines. Based on a patch by Thorsten Glaser <tg@mirbsd.de>.
  * Modify dpkg-gencontrol and dpkg-distaddfile to grab a write lock
    on debian/control before updating debian/files to avoid simultaneous
    updates. Closes: #642608
    Add libfile-fcntllock-perl to dpkg-dev's Depends since we use this module
    to handle the locking.
  * Update dpkg-gensymbols(1) to clarify that -e accepts shell patterns
    expansions and not regular expressions. And let dpkg-gensymbols output a
    warning when a pattern doesn't match any file. Closes: #649248
  * Add new option "-a <arch>" to dpkg-checkbuilddeps to check build
    dependencies for another architecture. This is really basic for now since
    it assumes all build dependencies must be satisfied on the listed
    architecture. Closes: #648180 Thanks to Colin Watson for the patch.
  * Error out if a dpkg database .list file is not a regular file. LP: #369898
  * Fix dpkg-mergechangelogs to not error out on invalid versions.

  * Further clarify in dpkg-source(1) the conditions under which it's possible
    to pass an explicit patch file to dpkg-source --commit.
  * Add new --query-features command to dpkg-buildflags. Thanks to Kees Cook

  * Clean up dpkg-architecture(1) dropping useless information and
    adding a reference to /usr/share/dpkg/architecture.mk.
  * Update dpkg-buildpackage to use the "build-arch" (for -B) and
    "build-indep" (for -A) targets unless "make -qn" says that they do not
    exist. Closes: #229357
  * Improve deb-shlibs(5) to mention that the dependency field must
    use the same syntax as a Depends field. Closes: #658696
  * Update dpkg-maintscript-helper(1) to recommend usage of the version
    removing/renaming a conffile with a "~" suffix as "priorversion"
    parameter. Thanks to Sam Morris <sam@robots.org.uk> for the patch.

  * Implement new --abort-on-upstream-changes option for dpkg-source with
    source formats 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 (quilt). It aborts every time that you try
    to build a source package which contains (unmanaged) changes to the
    upstream source code. Closes: #579012
  * dpkg-source now captures the output of patch and prints it on error so
    that the user can better diagnose what went wrong. Closes: #575304
  * Fix Dpkg::Changelog to cope properly with an entry of version "0".
    Add non-regression test for this. Closes: #587382
  * Add --export command to dpkg-buildflags to be used in shell with eval.
  * Modify source format "3.0 (git)" to use git bundles. Thanks to Joey Hess
    for the patch.
    The usage of git bundle avoids distributing cruft. Closes: #477954
    It's no longer needed to tell which branch contains the debian packaging,
    it uses automatically the one that was used at build-time. Closes: #534637
  * Pass --no-name option to gzip to avoid encoding the timestamp in the file
    so that the result is more predictable. Closes: #587724
    Also pass --rsyncable to make source packages more rsync friendly.
  * Replace dpkg-source's tar ignore pattern "*~" with "*/*~" to avoid
    matching on the top level directory. Closes: #588265
  * In source formats "2.0" and "3.0 (quilt)", make sure to remove the
    upstream-provided debian directory before copying the debian-provided
    version of that directory in place. Closes: #590297

  * Require gettext 0.18:
    - Remove embedded gettext files from the repository, now properly
      installed by autopoint for all po/ directories.
    - Add versioned Build-Depends.
  * Fix variable usage after delete in dselect.
  * Change default configure admindir to LOCALSTATEDIR/lib/dpkg from
    LOCALSTATEDIR/dpkg, so that we can use a correct --localstatedir=/var.
  * Add two new dpkg options --path-exclude and --path-include for filtering
    files on package installation. This allows embedded systems to skip
    /usr/share/doc, manpages, etc. Based on work from Tollef Fog Heen and
    Martin Pitt, thanks! Closes: #68788, #68861, #497304, #525567, #583902
  * Remove obsolete internal status aliases “postinst-failed” for
    stat_halfconfigured and “removal-failed” for stat_halfinstalled.
  * Check version syntax when parsing it from libdpkg based programs.
    Closes: #574704
  * Rewrite mksplit in C, and merge it into dpkg-split.
  * Rewrite dpkg-divert in C.
  * Use linux-any wildcard for libselinux1-dev Build-Depends instead of
    using a list of negated architectures.
  * Use Breaks instead of Conflicts in dpkg, dpkg-dev and libdpkg-perl binary
    packages.
  * Move Dpkg.pm and Dpkg/Gettext.pm from dpkg to libdpkg-perl.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.1.
  * Detect when another process has locked the database, and mention that
    problematic dpkg --audit results might be due to ongoing operations.
    Closes: #80252
  * Add new dpkg --force-confask option that forces a conffile prompt when
    the conffile from the new package does not differ from the previous one.
    Thanks to Henning Makholm <henning@makholm.net>. Closes: #102609
  * On dpkg-divert --rename, check if the source file exists, and disable
    renaming if it does not. Closes: #550252
    As a side effect, this avoids useless errors when the destination
    directory is not existent or writable. Closes: #581544
  * Properly compute the longest package description from all to be displayed
    on “dpkg-query --list”, so that it does not get incorrectly trimmed.
  * Consistently use earlier/later instead of smaller/bigger when describing
    comparison relationships. Closes: #587641
  * Stop exporting DPKG_LIBDIR to maintainer scripts, no need for it anymore.
  * Assign correct SE Linux label on non-regular files. Based on a patch by
    Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>. Closes: #587949
  * Add -F option to dpkg-buildpackage to be able to explicitly specify a
    normal full build and combine it with -nc. Closes: #547993
  * Add missing mentions of the Breaks field alongside the other fields
    sharing the same syntax in deb-control(5).

  * Update deb-substvars(5) to codify how variables containing multiple
    lines must be managed.
  * Fix boolean evaluation of Dpkg::Version so that version 0 evaluates to
    false and dpkg-shlibdeps can strip the minimal version specification.

dpkg (1.15.7) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Raphaël Hertzog ]
  * Clarify the plan concerning dpkg-source, debian/source/format and
    the default source format in dpkg-source(1). Add a warning
    in dpkg-source to invite people to always create debian/source/format.
    We deprecate the fallback to "1.0" (it's there for backwards compatibility
    only) and debian/source/format is going to be mandatory at some point in
    the future. Closes: #553928
  * Add .gitattributes to list of files ignored by dpkg-source.
  * Document most common warnings and errors of dpkg-source in its manual
    page.
  * Let dpkg-source read options from debian/source/local-options as well but
    do not include that file in the generated source package.
  * Improve explanation of --all option in dpkg-parsechangelog(1). Thanks to
    Jari Aalto. Closes: #575706
  * Fix dpkg to not lose package metadata on filesystems where readdir()
    returns new files added after the opendir() call, btrfs in particular
    triggered the problematic behaviour. Closes: #575891
  * Tigthen the regex used by dpkg-source to match the component name of
    supplementary tarballs so that underscore (_) are not allowed as it was
    supposed to be.
  * Introduce a new script called dpkg-buildflags: its purpose is to retrieve
    compilation flags and it should be used within debian/rules to pass
    the right compilation flags to the build process. dpkg-builpackage still
    exports them to not break packages currently relying on them but packages
    should now start using dpkg-buildflags instead. Closes: #560070
  * For Ubuntu set default value of LDFLAGS to -Wl,-Bsymbolic-functions.
  * Cleanup some old Conflicts/Replaces, thanks to Helge Kreutzmann.
  * Modify dselect to treat all unknown package as known and marked for purge.
    This is a temporary work-around so that dselect doesn't try to reinstall
    packages of priority > standard that were removed or not installed. Thanks
    to Robert Luberda for the patch. Closes: #559519, #556889
  * dpkg now exports DPKG_MAINTSCRIPT_NAME to maintainer scripts with the
    type of maintainer script currently running (preinst, postinst, prerm,
    postrm). Closes: #546577
  * dpkg now exports DPKG_LIBDIR to maintainer scripts pointing to the
    private directory containing internal programs like the upcoming
    maintscript-helper.
  * Add $DPKG_LIBDIR/maintscript-helper program that can be used in
    maintainer scripts to perform common operations working around
    current dpkg limitations: first version supports removing obsolete
    conffiles and renaming conffiles. Closes: #514316

  * Add new script dpkg-mergechangelogs to do 3-way merges of Debian
    changelogs. Add libalgorithm-merge-perl to Recommends for the
    benefit of this script.

  * Always use C99 variadic macros, as the build requires them anyway, we
    avoid exposing the configure variable HAVE_C99 on installed headers.
  * Use __attribute__ keyword depending on compiler support, we avoid
    exposing the configure variable HAVE_C_ATTRIBUTE on installed headers.
  * Do not allow a --retry schedule in start-stop-daemon where forever is
    the last item, as it needs something to repeat over. Closes: #570938
  * Show dselect dependency/conflicts resolution screen again, by switching
    the code to use STL's min() and max() instead of preprocessor macros, to
    avoid multiple evaluation of arguments. Regression introduced in 1.15.6.
    Based on a patch by Robert Luberda <robert@debian.org>. Closes: #574816
  * Defer the fsync and rename for normal files in tar extraction so that
    it's done in one pass afterwards, to avoid massive I/O degradation due to

    - prefix public functions in Dpkg::Deps with deps_ and export them
      by default
    - rename Dpkg::Source::Compressor in Dpkg::Compression::Process
    - rename Dpkg::Source::CompressedFile in Dpkg::Compression::FileHandle
      and completely redesign its API
    - update Dpkg::Compression's API to use compression_* functions
      instead of granting direct access to variables, integrate
      there management of default compression
    - introduce Dpkg::Interface::Storable and update many modules
      to make use of it
    - update Dpkg::BuildOptions to provide an object-oriented interface
    - update Dpkg::Checksums to provide an object-oriented interface
  * Drop debian-maintainers from Suggests since it's obsolete, the
    corresponding keyring is in debian-keyring.
  * Merge support of symbol patterns in dpkg-gensymbols. Thanks to
    Modestas Vainius for his work (see further for more details).
  * Accept filename with spaces and colon in the output of objdump.
    Required so that dpkg-shlibdeps support such files properly.
    Thanks to Raphaël Geissert for the patch. Closes: #565712
  * When unpacking a "3.0 (quilt)" source package, tell quilt where

  * Add $VERSION numbers to all perl modules. Closes: #465256
    1.00 and higher means that the API should be stable
  * While parsing diff's output, accept any sentence that contains the word
    differ (as specified by POSIX) to identify that binary files could not be
    compared. Closes: #570008
  * dpkg-gencontrol does no longer accept arch-specific dependencies in
    arch: all packages. Closes: #560071
  * dpkg-gencontrol no longer warns if a substitution variable provided by -V
    is not used (the warning is meant to catch unused substitutions coming
    from the file, those are package specific with debhelper). Closes: #557133
  * dpkg-gencontrol now indicates which package is concerned by the substvars
    warning that it displays. Closes: #566837
  * dpkg-buildpackage now supports options --source-option=<opt> and
    --changes-option=<opt> to forward arbitrary options to dpkg-source and
    dpkg-genchanges respectively. Closes: #566230
  * The -T option of dpkg-{source,gencontrol,genchanges} can now be used
    multiple times to read substitution variables from multiple files.
    Closes: #363323
  * dpkg-source now supports an option --create-empty-orig in formats
    "2.0" and "3.0 (quilt)" to auto-create the main original tarball when
    there are supplementary tarballs. This makes it easier to bundle
    multiple software together. Closes: #554488
  * dpkg-source supports long option names --diff-ignore and --tar-ignore for
    -i and -I. A new option --extend-diff-ignore is introduced. Those options
    can thus now be used in debian/source/options.
  * Generate manual pages for perl modules.

  * Modify dpkg-source to error out when it would apply patches containing
    insecure paths (with "/../") and also error out when it would apply a
    patch through a symlink. Those checks are required as patch will happily
    modify files outside of the target directory and unpacking a source package
    should not be able to have any side-effect outside of the target
    directory. Fixes CVE-2010-0396.
  * Also error out when the quilt series contains a path with "/../" as this

  * Make “dpkg-statoverride --quiet” actually do something, and quiesce
    most of the inoquous warning messages. Closes: #403211
  * Make “dpkg-statoverride --update --add” fail if it cannot update the
    mode and owner of the file. This would fail later on when dpkg itself
    applies the overrides, so better to signal this earlier.
  * Add sparc64 to cputable. Thanks to Aurelien Jarno <aurel32@debian.org>.

  * Use xz command to handle lzma compressed files in dpkg and dpkg-dev.
    This removes the lzma package from both dpkg and dpkg-dev dependencies.
  * Do not set PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR in dpkg-buildpackage when cross-building.
    The proper solution to this is to let the build system choose the
    appropriate pkg-config binary for the build or host system in the same
    way pkg.m4 is handling it now. Closes: #551118
  * Dynamically link against all external libraries. This includes libbz2

  * Mark the libdpkg.a API as volatile and require any possible users to set
    LIBDPKG_VOLATILE_API to acknowledge that fact.
  * Add a new libdpkg-dev package with the headers and the static library,
    although its API should be considered volatile.
  * Reorganize the doc contents that goes into each package:
    - README.multicd only in dselect.
    - README.api only in development packages, dpkg-dev and libdpkg-dev.
    - triggers.txt only in dpkg-dev.
  * Move source.lintian-overrides to debian/source/lintian-overrides.
  * Switch SE Linux support to explicitly set path context. This fixes the

  [ Modestas Vainius ]
  * Implement symbol patterns (Closes: #563752). From now on, it is possible to
    match multiple symbols with a single entry in the symbol file template.
    While the concept is not new (wildcards also match multiple symbols),
    patterns cover much more ground and are a lot more flexible. Together with
    the framework, 3 basic pattern types are supported:
    - c++ - matching C++ symbols by their demangled name (as emitted by
      c++filt);
    - symver - matching by symbol version. It replaces the wildcards feature
      which is still supported for backwards compatibility but is reimplemented
      on top of the new framework;
    - regex - matching symbol names with perl regular expression.
    Basic patterns may be combined where it makes sense.
  * As a positive side effect of the new symbol patterns implementation,
    patterns are now treated like normal symbols whenever possible, e.g. a
    pattern is MISSING if it does not match anything. As a result,
    dpkg-gensymbols is now able to detect NEW/MISSING symbols when patterns are
    present in the symbol file (Closes: #541464). Please note, however, that
    there is no way to detect symbol changes in the pattern match sets.
  * Add source version to the dpkg-gensymbols diff label, reformat it according

  * Make dpkg as strict as dpkg-statoverride on input when validating the
    parsed data from the statdb.
  * Rewrite dpkg-statoverride in C.
  * Use C99 snprintf function family semantics to avoid having to call them
    in a loop to grow the varbuf buffer. This should reduce memory usage and
    be slightly faster on varbufprintf calls.
  * Use the size from stat to allocate the buffers for readlink, instead of
    indefinitely calling readlink and growing the buffer. This should reduce
    memory usage when handling lots of symlinks, and be slightly faster.
  * Rework varbuf api to avoid increasing buffers indefinitely when adding
    content to them, regardless of space being already available.
  * Fix build macros to allow start-stop-deaemon to use TIOCNOTTY.
  * Generate the autoconf version from git to make it easier to see when a

    that /etc/dpkg/origins/default exists. Closes: #545274
  * Update Standards-Version to 3.8.3 (no changes needed).
  * Major changes to the perl API:
    - Dpkg::Control is now Dpkg::Control::Info
    - Dpkg::Cdata is gone and is replaced by a new Dpkg::Control
    - Dpkg::Control::Fields contains authoritative information
      about fields allowed in various types of control information
      (and can be customized by each vendor). It also integrates
      information that was previously available through Dpkg::Deps.
    - Dpkg::Changelog has been split in multiple modules and largely
      modified to offer an interface that is now more in line with the
      other modules.
  * All dpkg-* perl programs that work with control information have been
    updated to use the new Dpkg::Control interface.

    the source format that would be used during a build.
  * Modify dpkg-source -b to use default build options from
    debian/source/options. Thus it's now possible to have sticky options, for
    example for the choice of a compression method (--compression=<comp>).
  * dpkg-source outputs the list of upstream files modified by the diff.gz
    (applies only to source packages using format 1.0). Closes: #482166

  * Do not remap obsolete fields in dpkg-scanpackages as they have been

dpkg (1.15.1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Raphaël Hertzog ]
  * Fix dpkg-genchanges to not include the additional upstream tarballs
    when they are not desired (specific to source packages using format 3.0
    quilt).
  * Call quilt only once to apply all patches instead of once per patch
    when building 3.0 (quilt) source packages. Closes: #518453
  * Fix dpkg-shlibdeps so that it works again when analyzing binaries
    outside of package's directory. Closes: #518687
  * Modify dpkg-shlibdeps to let shlibs.local override symbols files too.
  * Drop support of debian/control's “Format” field used by dpkg-source while
    it's not too late. Instead debian/source/format should be used to indicate
    the desired source package format.
  * Update deb-triggers(5) and dpkg-trigger(1) to add a reference to
    /usr/share/doc/dpkg/triggers.txt.gz. Closes: #519717
  * Avoid perl warnings in dpkg-gencontrol and dpkg-genchanges when the
    Architecture field is missing in a binary package. Closes: #510282
  * Modify Dpkg::Version::check_version() to not die by default.
    Closes: #510615
  * dpkg-source now ignores all possible vi swap file extensions (and not
    only .swp). The corresponding exclude pattern for -I also got tightened to
    only catch filenames starting with a dot. Closes: #515540
  * dpkg-gencontrol displays a better error message when an ORed dependency
    is used in a union field like Conflicts, Replaces or Breaks.
    Closes: #489238
  * dpkg-source's signature check is now done with gpgv if possible and
    timeouts if not completed within 10 seconds. Closes: #490929
    When using gpg, use --no-default-keyring to be consistent with gpgv's
    behaviour to not use the user's keyring. Closes: #440841
  * Update dpkg-dev dependencies: Closes: #472942
    - Move gnupg to Recommends. It's needed to sign .dsc and .changes.
    - Add gpgv to Recommends. Useful to check signatures of extracted packages.
    - Add debian-maintainers to Suggests. Together with debian-keyring they
    contain all the GPG keys required to verify official Debian packages.
  * Drop /etc/dpkg/origins as it's taken over by base-files (see #487437).
  * Fix dpkg-shlibdeps to properly initialize a symbol-based dependency
    even when some symbols are associated with a (fake) version "0". Such a
    version means that the symbol has always existed in all versions of the
    package.
  * When dpkg delegates to dpkg-query or dpkg-deb to do the actual work, add
    the "--" marker to explicitly document the end of options so that
    arguments starting with a dash are not interpreted as options.
    Closes: #293163
    Thanks to Bill Allombert for the patch.
  * dpkg now correctly refuses empty parameters when an integer value is
    wanted. Closes: #386197 Based on a patch by Bill Allombert.
  * Fix a mistake in the french translation of dpkg's manual page.
    Thanks to Jonathan Gibert. Closes: #522032
  * Fix dpkg-source to not die when uncompressor processes are killed by
    SIGPIPE due to tar closing the pipe without exhausting all the data
    available. Closes: #523329
  * dpkg-gencontrol now handles properly (empty) dependencies which contain
    only spaces. Closes: #522787
  * dpkg-source now accepts additional tarballs (in format "3.0 (quilt)")
    with a "component" name containing dashes. Closes: #524376
  * Fix dpkg-source to not complain on binary files that are ignored and are
    not going to be included in the debian tarball of a "3.0 (quilt)" source
    package. Closes: #524375
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.1 (no change required).
  * Do not store usernames and group names in tarballs created by dpkg-source,
    they are anyway ignored at unpack time. Closes: #523184
  * Fix update-alternatives to not remove real files installed in place of
    an alternative link when the corresponding alternative is fully removed.
    Closes: #526538
  * Add a new dpkg-vendor tool to query vendor information stored in
    /etc/dpkg/origins. It can be used in debian/rules to enable different
    behaviour depending on the current vendor at the time of the build.
    Closes: #498380
    Modify dpkg-buildpackage to not set the DEB_VENDOR environment variable,
    packages should use the dpkg-vendor program instead.
  * Ensure that the automatic patch created in format "3.0 (quilt)" is always
    well registered with quilt even when it's updated by a new call to
    dpkg-source. Thanks to Goswin von Brederlow for the initial patch.
    Closes: #525858
  * Do not update/create debian/patches/.dpkg-source-applied during build,
    it's only meant to document what patches have been applied at extraction
    time. Closes: #525835
  * Let dpkg-buildpackage add the missing execute right on debian/rules if
    needed. Display a warning when it happens. Closes: #499088
  * Allow to combine -nc and -S in dpkg-buildpackage but display a warning
    saying that it's not advised. Closes: #304404
  * Let dpkg-buildpackage error out with subprocerr() when dpkg-checkbuilddeps
    is interrupted/killed by a signal. Closes: #498734
  * Fix dpkg-buildpackage/dpkg-genchanges to properly interpret option -v0.
    Closes: #475916
  * Improves how dpkg-parsechangelog handles non-existing versions
    in its --since, --until, --to, --from options. Approximate the intent
    by selecting the nearest version instead. Closes: #477638
  * Update dpkg-parsechangelog's documentation to make it clearer that spaces
    are not allowed between single characters options and their values.
    Closes: #494883
  * Don't let dpkg-scanpackages complain about missing overrides when
    no overrides file has been given. Closes: #468106
    Thanks to Piotr Engelking for the patch.

  [ Guillem Jover ]
  * Fix typo in dpkg output (‘unexecpted’ → ‘unexpected’). Closes: #519082
    Thanks to Ivan Masár.
  * Sync archtable with architectures currently present in Debian sid.
    - Remove m68k.
    - Add kfreebsd-i386 and kfreebsd-amd64.

    have been disabled from configure.
  * Move Debian specific keyrings to the Debian vendor class and change the
    Ubuntu vendor class to inherit from it.
  * Do not set the Arch substvar in dpkg-source, avoiding generating warnings
    when there's no compiler present. Closes: #526132

    and stop producing warnings.
  * Make deprecated dpkg-scanpackages --udeb option produce a warning.
  * Change dpkg-source --help output to state there's no default substvar
    file to match reality.
  * Warn in start-stop-daemon if the argument to --name is longer than the
    supported kernel process name size. Closes: #353015, #519128
  * Do not warn in dpkg-deb when parsing unknown fields with the “Private-”
    prefix. Based on a patch by Nils Rennebarth. Closes: #353040

  [ Frank Lichtenheld ]
  * Dpkg::Version: Remove unnecessary function next_elem which just
    replicates the standard shift behaviour.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Add "keyrings" vendor hook, used by dpkg-source to allow vendors to
    supply additional keyrings against which source package signatures will
    be verified. Implement this for Ubuntu. Closes: #525834

    input with "-c-". Closes: #465340
  * Add DEB_VENDOR environment variable in the build environment to be able
    to change behaviour dynamically depending on the vendor of the current
    system (or target system when the user overrides DEB_VENDOR by setting
    it himself). Closes: #457371

    libraries when the shared library is a non-public directory and is likely
    to be a plugin. Closes: #481165

    select between manual and auto in --config and --all. Closes: #392430
  * Fix update-alternatives to not switch to manual mode an alternative
    with a broken symlink (instead let the current action fix it).
    Also ensure that a message is displayed by default when such a switch is
    made. Closes: #141325, #87677
  * Fix update-alternatives' logic to rename files. It failed to ignore errors
    in some cases where it wanted to when the source file didn't exist.
    Closes: #99870
    This also makes update-alternatives less noisy when this happens since we
    don't call mv when we know that it's going to fail.
    Closes: #98822
  * Properly remove inappropriate slave links in update-alternatives even when
    we switch to manual mode with --set or --config. Closes: #388313
  * Modify update-alternatives to always remove the alternative group when the
    last alternative is removed (even in manual mode).
  * Ensure that update-alternative --install fix the links if the alternative

    any debian/rules target with the proper build environment.
    Closes: #477916
  * Move update-alternatives, dpkg-divert and dpkg-statoverride to /usr/bin
    but keep compatibility symlinks in /usr/sbin for the squeeze release
    until all maintainer scripts are fixed (see
    http://lintian.debian.org/tags/command-with-path-in-maintainer-script.html).
    Closes: #216606
  * Use dh_lintian to install lintian overrides. Build-Depends on debhelper
    (>= 6.0.7) for this. Update debhelper compatibility level to 6 at the same
    time.
  * Drop cleanup-info script.
  * Reset umask to 0022 in dpkg-gencontrol and dpkg-gensymbols to ensure that
    files created in the DEBIAN directory have sane permissions.
    Closes: #516481
  * Rewrite update-alternatives (so that we can understand it again) and
    implement new features on top of it:
    - the --config output is now sorted. Closes: #437060
    - it now logs information to /var/log/dpkg.log. Closes: #445270
    - it forbids reusing master alternative as slave and vice-versa.
      Closes: #342566
    - it forbids reusing alternative links managed by other alternatives
    - new sanity checks on --install parameters. Closes: #423176
    - install slave link only if the corresponding slave file is available.
      Closes: #143701
    - new option --get-selections to export the configuration of all
      alternatives. It's a simple way to discover the name of all available
      alternatives. Closes: #273406, #392429
    - new option --set-selections to reconfigure a set of alternatives in
      a single command.
  * Document in update-alternatives(8) how one can repair all broken
    alternatives with a single command. Closes: #250258, #395556
  * Modify dpkg-gensymbols to replace #PACKAGE# on the fly while installing
    symbols files so that package having libraries whose name varies between
    architectures do not need to hardcode the package name. Closes: #517264

  * The last "small fix" actually broke conversion of source packages to
    "3.0 (quilt)" format when they have local changes and no pre-existing
    quilt series file. Now always provide a valid name in QUILT_SERIES.

  * Fix dpkg-gensymbols to not scan (real) directories accessed through a

dpkg (1.14.18) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Guillem Jover ]
  * Bump po4a version in Build-Depends to 0.33.1-1, as usage of UTF-8
    in original man pages was causing build failures. Closes: #473498
  * Add triggers documentation to dpkg-dev. Closes: #473449
  * Add deb-triggers.5 and dpkg-trigger.1 man pages, and document new
    statuses and options in dpkg.1.

  [ Raphaël Hertzog ]
  * When dpkg-source builds a source package of Format: 2.0 or 3.0 (quilt) it
    applies the patches before the build if
    debian/patches/.dpkg-source-applied doesn't exist. This file is created
    during extraction if patches are applied, and is auto-excluded from the
    debian tarball. This enables on-the-fly conversion of source packages from
    Format: 1.0 to Format: 3.0 (quilt) without manual intervention of the
    user. This feature can be disabled with the option --no-preparation.
  * The dpkg-source option --skip-patches disables application of patches
    during extraction of source packages using Format: 2.0 or Format: 3.0
    (quilt).
  * Ensure the Files field is last in *.dsc and *.changes. This is a
    work-around for some braindead dsc parsers (dupload and sbuild for
    instance, see #473518 and #470440).
  * Initialize dependencies for libraries having symbols files with the
    smallest minimal version listed in the symbols file instead of using
    an unversioned dependency. It's the only way to ensure the library
    presence if it wasn't available in all versions of the package that ever
    existed. Closes: #474079

    - drop unused overrides
    - updated several manual pages to fix hyphen-used-as-minus-sign
    - fixed manpage-has-errors-from-man in several manual pages
    - removed empty debian/dpkg.prerm
  * Removed old upgrade code from dpkg's preinst and postinst which only
    concerns upgrading from dpkg version older than the one in oldstable
    already. And thus we get rid of old the last usage of read in those
    scripts (fixes lintian's warning read-in-maintainer-script).
  * Removed sorting of dependencies in dpkg-gencontrol and dpkg-source. But
    kept it for all other fields (Enhances, Conflicts, Replaces, Breaks,
    Build-Conflicts and Build-Conflicts-Indep).
  * Instead changed dpkg-shlibdeps to sort the dependencies generated in
    ${shlibs:*} variables.
  * Changed the logic of simplification of dependencies: if any dependency
    must be discarded due to another dependency appearing further
    in the field, the superseding dependency will take the place of the
    discarded one. Added a test case for this.
  * dpkg-shlibdeps properly accounts usage of symbols provided by private
    libraries without SONAME. Closes: #469838
  * Add a new warning to dpkg-shlibdeps when a library NEEDED is in fact
    not used by any of the binaries analyzed. Closes: #472332
  * Add a new --warnings=<value> option to select the set of warnings to
    activate. By default, do not activate the warning about useless
    libraries at the binary level (instead the new warning above is activated
    by default: it's less strict and more useful).
  * dpkg-source has been heavily refactored to make it easier to support
    multiple source package formats. Several new source package formats have
    been added:
    - the format "2.0" is the original wig&pen
    - the format "3.0 (quilt)" is based on 2.0. It uses a tarball for the
      debian directory and can thus include binary files. Binaries
      outside of the debian directory can be also included if they
      are listed in debian/source/include-binaries (and option
      --include-binaries will generate this file automatically).
      Closes: #4588, #4628
    - thus it will also preserve timestamps on Debian-provided
      documentation like README.Debian. Closes: #366555
    - it handles an explicit series of patches and the patch can thus be
      named without constraints. Patches can contain arbitrary
      headers/comments between file chunks. Closes: #363018
    - it ignores changes on a number of temporary and VCS-specific files
      by default. Closes: #203792, #323909
    - the patches in debian/patches can remove files. Closes: #12564
    - the patches are applied at unpack time. Closes: #463048
    - the formats "3.0 (quilt/native)" don't include VCS directories by
      default. Closes: #435126
    - the format "3.0 (custom)" can be used to create a source package
      containing arbitrary files. It's useful for helper tools that can
      generate the files by themselves in a more efficient way
      (like all the *-buildpackage tools). Closes: #246918
    - the formats "3.0 (git/bzr)" are experimental formats based
      on corresponding VCS repositories. Thanks to Joey Hess and Colin Watson
      respectively.
  * dpkg-source has a new --no-check option. It disables GPG check and
    checksums checks. Closes: #220758
  * dpkg-shlibdeps is now able to look into directories containing libraries
    used by cross-built binaries provided that the right environment variable
    are set. Closes: #453267
  * Change default value of LDFLAGS (set by dpkg-buildpackage) to ''
    instead of '-Wl,-Bsymbolic-functions'. It's safer at this point of the
    release cycle.
  * dpkg-buildpackage will set PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR (but not override an existing
    value) in case of cross-compilation so that pkgconfig finds .pc files
    in the directory specific to the target architecture. Closes: #439979

  * Add build-essential as an implicit Build-Depends in dpkg-checkbuilddeps.
    Closes: #402901
  * Add build-essential to dpkg-dev Recommends.
  * Do not warn about unrecognized Homepage field in binary package stanzas
    in dpkg-genchanges and dpkg-source. Closes: #460309
  * Do not use the enoent helper binary, and use perl POSIX module instead.
  * Keep checking for the process when start-stop-daemon is called with
    --retry even if the daemon removed the pidfile. Closes: #460903
    Thanks to Justin Pryzby for the analysis.
  * Make --quiet silence --test in start-stop-daemon. Closes: #367998
  * Check current uid and gid in start-stop-daemon before calling setuid,
    setgid and initgroups. Closes: #222524
    Based on a patch by Samuel Thibault.
  * Remove unimplemented --test option from update-alternatives.
    Closes: #392432, #461247
  * Additionally check if errno is EEXIST after rmdir(2), as SUSv3 specifies
    that on non-empty directories it can either return that or ENOTEMPTY.
    This fixes run time problems on Solaris.
  * Fix start-stop-daemon --help output to state that --name is one of the
    possible required options to use. Closes: #354999
  * Demote dselect from priority important to optional. Closes: #461327
  * Fix portability issues on HP-UX, by not using backticks inside double
    quotes in m4 files. Closes: #24514
  * Switch Maintainer address to <debian-dpkg@lists.debian.org> from
    <team@dpkg.org>.
  * Add README.feature-removal-schedule describing the features to be removed
    and README.api describing the provided APIs.

  * Make the -L option of dpkg-parsechangelog actually work (it's
    only been eleven years...)
  * Import the code from my external Parse::DebianChangelog as
    Dpkg::Changelog and Dpkg::Changelog::Debian. Using this
    from parsechangelog/debian adds the following requested
    features:
     - Option to use a non-lossy format. Closes: #95579
     - Various options to better control how many entries
       should be displayed. Closes: #226932

  * Replaced all the remaining code in controllib.pl by new modules. All
    scripts have been adjusted to use the new modules and controllib.pl has
    been removed.
  * The code to parse debian/control is available in a perl module
    Dpkg::Control. Closes: #26554
  * Temporarily add a Breaks: dpkg-dev (= 1.14.13), dpkg-dev (= 1.14.14) on
    dpkg for the convenience of sid users. Closes: #459815
  * Update dpkg-source(1) to explain better what the directory after -b is.
    Closes: #323606
  * Also force version in ${binary:Version} if dpkg-gencontrol -v<version>
    is used. That way we're consistent with the definition of that variable
    in deb-substvars(5). Closes: #433477
  * Add support of Dm-Upload-Allowed field. Closes: #453400
  * Fix dpkg-shlibdeps' filtering of duplicated dependencies in fields of
    lesser priority (when -d is used).
  * Fix behaviour of dpkg-shlibdeps when the same binary was passed multiple
    times for use in different dependency fields (-d option).
  * Change logic of -si option of dpkg-genchanges to include the original
    tarball only if the current upstream version differs from the upstream
    version of the previous changelog entry. Replaces the heuristic based
    on revision number (-0, -0.1 or -1). Closes: #28701
  * Some code refactoring on dpkg-genchanges and bug fixes in the generation
    of the Description: field. As a result, source only uploads will no more
    have Description fields.
  * Add support of wildcard entries in symbols files. This makes it much
    simpler to write symbols files for well managed libraries but in that case
    dpkg-gensymbols can't check any more if symbols have disappeared.

    Closes: #453364
  * Copy the usr/share/doc directory to dpkg-dev and dselect (Instead

dpkg (1.14.8) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Raphaël Hertzog ]
  * Heavy rework of dpkg-shlibdeps:
    - Support "symbols" files to generate finer-grained dependencies.
      Those files can be created by the new dpkg-gensymbols command.
      Closes: #430367
    - Uses now all paths in RPATH (instead of only the first).
      Closes: #395942
    - Support parsing include directives in /etc/ld.so.conf. Closes: #431597
    - Libraries are also searched in the public directories of packages
      being built and thus debian/shlibs.local can effectively define
      dependencies for libraries that are being built. Closes: #80340
    - "symbols" files use the full SONAME as key instead of splitting it in
      (name, version) like in the "shlibs" format. This allows binaries to
      be linked with unversioned libraries and not fail. Note that
      unversioned libraries are still a very bad idea.  Closes: #48208
    - dpkg-shlibdeps now supports '-x<package>' options that can be used to
      exclude packages from generated dependencies (use with care though).
      Closes: #41907, #109954
    - If dpkg-shlibdeps doesn't find any dependency information for a
      shared library that is actively used, then it will fail. This can be
      disabled with the option '--ignore-missing-info'. Closes: #10807
  * Switch perl programs to use the new Dpkg::Deps module. This changes the
    behaviour of dpkg-gencontrol and dpkg-source which will rewrite and
    simplify dependencies and build dependencies as possible. Multiple
    dependencies on the same package are replaced by their intersection.

  * Allow to use other compressions than gzip on dpkg-source -b

dpkg (1.13.11) unstable; urgency=low

  The "Good, clean fun" Release.

  * Fixed the always broken error handling so that only the intended
    cleanup handlers are run, rather than ones that we didn't expect.
    This corrects the bug when a package's postrm fails and the package is
    left in an installed state with no files; the package will now be left
    in a half-installed state, as originally intended.  Found by Marga
    Manterola while documenting the maintainer scripts.  Closes: #296026.
  * Fixed removal of files involved in diversions during upgrade, caused by
    checking whether the "directory" was in use by another package without
    actually checking whether or not it was a directory.  Closes: #310390.
  * Fixed package saving to not disappear packages who divert anything from
    the installing package out of the way.  Closes: #113626.
  * Improved clean-up of unpack failure during install or upgrade, to leave
    the system in exactly the same state as it started in.

dpkg (1.13.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Stop dpkg-source clobbering an existing .orig directory during unpacking.
    Closes: #21236.
  * Allow an alternate output directory to be specified to dpkg-source by

    * No longer validate dependency fields when reading the control file.
      Some fields may have vars in them, which breaks the validation.

      the controllib parser did.
    * All dependency fields parsed by controllib.pl support [arch]
      specifiers.  If the arch specifier doesn't apply for the current
      arch, then the item will not be added to the internal list structure.
    * Comment lines(that begin with '#') are removed during parsing.
    * Store the original casing of field names, for use in error reporting.
    * Store the original field's casing with 'o:' prepended in %fi.
      * ballombe@merulo.debian.org:

    error).  Closes: #101813, and partially 101845.
  * Don't error out if the files in the tar have leading './', for
    dpkg-source.  (another partial close of 101845).
  * Handle the case where a single directory exists in the orig.tar.gz, but
    it is NOT of the form <pkg>-<ver>.  Closes: #101845.
  * Set LC_ALL in dpkg-source when we call external programs when we are
    going to parse their output.  Another bug from 101845.
  * Handle stating of truncated cpio filenames(100 char limit, bah), in
    dpkg-source.  Another bug from 101845.
  * Add support for an Uploaders field, which is read from the first
    paragraph of debian/control, and propagated to the .dsc.  This lists
    the people allowed to upload a package.  If it is not set, then the
    value of the Maintainer is placed into this field of the .dsc.  This
    bumps the .dsc format to 1.1.  Closes: #101815.

  * warn instead of die when find returns an error(which happens if there
    is a dangling symlink, because we use -follow).  Closes: #51479.

  * Things should mostly work OpenBSD 2.8 as well now
  * Added a --status-pipe option.
  * Fixed several memleaks.
  * Profiled dpkg.

      gave a speedup of 33% on a dual celeron 333, when reading status and
      available.
    * various other speedups.
  * Removed all --smallmem code, as smallmem and largemem now actually

dpkg (1.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Major overhaul of the buildsystem

  * Move to version 1.6 to reflect the amount of changes made
  * Fix mixup with Czech and Polish translations, Closes: Bug# 48986
  * utils/start-stop-daemon.c: Added ability for user.group arg to
    --chuid. Also, always call initgroups() when using --chuid.

dpkg (1.4.1.19) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix replaces for dpkg-dev
  * Add gettext-support to dselect
  * Added Czech and Polish translations for dpkg
  * Fixed incorrect patch for --print-architecture (oops, oh well
    it was already broken when there was no gcc anyway :)
  * Fixed missing mipseb that was supposed to be in the archtable
  * Better output in update-alternatives --config, now shows the
    current, and the preferred choices.
  * dpkg-name: ignore epoch when getting version
  * 50dpkg-dev.el: add it as a conffile for dpkg-dev
  * internals.sgml: Removed references to the versions of build tools,
    they date the document.
  * debian-changelog-mode.el: added hint for better log-email handling
  * Added recognition for new source-depends fields for policy
    referenced in bug #41232
  * dpkg-buildpackage: add -ap option to force a pause prior to starting
    the sign process. This helps for people who don't keep their signatures
    on the filesystem (on a floppy perhaps, then mount as needed).
  * minor script corrections
  * dpkg-dev control: Change gcc to c-compiler in the recommends field, and
    move cpio, patch and make to the depends line
  * Leave file info intact in available when installing packages. MD5sum,
    Filename, and MSDOS-Filename used to get lost when installing a
    package.
  * Added armv4l to archtable
  * Added 'D' to the list of choices for conffile handling, closes: #48137
  * Converted internals.sgml to debiandoc format. Also added a dpkg-doc
    package that contains the generated output from this file (.ps, .html
    and .info), includes doc-base support. Internals.sgml is also not
    generated on the binary-arch target, and is no longer "byhand"
  * dpkg-gencontrol: add "Source" to the fields placed in the control file
  * dpkg-parsechangelog: fixed loop for parsepath (#48526)
  * main/{processarc.c,depcon.c}: added new structure for conflictors,
    which contains a struct for conflicts. This is used to create an array
    of conflicting packages, which are going to be replaced. Allows for
    multiple conflicts and replaces. All conflictor handlers were
    converted to loops to handle each one (processarc.c).
  * dpkg-divert: Fix check for writable filesystem, closes: #48646

dpkg (1.4.1.18) unstable; urgency=low

  * Backout dep check patch

 -- Ben Collins <bcollins@debian.org>  Sat, 23 Oct 1999 00:39:24 -0400

dpkg (1.4.1.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add support for long filenames, along with --assert-longfilenames
  * Added --chuid option to start-stop-daemon to allow switching to
    a different uid when starting a process
  * Add mipseb and mipsel to the archtable too, since mips and mipseb are
    both viable names for the mips big endian arch, and mipsel is also needed
  * Update dpkg-architecure's archtable
  * Added --config option to update-alternatives to allow easy changing
    of the registered alternatives for a specific name
  * Updated the deb-control(5) man page with all the current fields
    and uses
  * Made the large info screen show 5 lines of the pkglist so that
    it scrolled properly, and still showed the cursor in dselect
  * Removed references to dpkg(5) which seems to not exist anymore
  * Fixed `dpkg-deb --help' and dpkg-deb(1) from reporting --no-check
    when it's actually --nocheck (went with the hardcoded option, so
    this is just a documentation fix).
  * Added better check in disk.setup for a working NFS server. Makes
    it compatible with other non-Linux servers.
  * Corrected dpkg(8)'s example of using dpkg -i (showed it used with
    a .tar.gz instead of a .deb)
  * Applied patch to correct improper TMPDIR handling in dpkg-deb
  * When encountering an error in extracting the tar archives in the
    packages, we should abort the install, not simply give an error
    and continue.
  * Make dpkg give the builtin arch if there was an error while exec()'ing
    the C compiler with --print-architecture. We still fail if the
    output from gcc was bad in some way, since they may be of importance.
  * Removed the maintainer-configure portion in debian/rules, since
    we should be shipping the source with all the auto* stuff
    already generated anyway
  * Removed the ltconfig patch, and resort to a debian/rules fix
    to libtool itself after running configure
  * Removed shlibs.default.i386. It's now a template for arch porting to
    Debian/dpkg, we install it still, if there exists a file matching the
    arch
  * Reimplemented a better *stat cache for the removal checking code,
    this helps a lot when doing upgrades where the packages are a lot
    different in layout
  * Increased largemem auto detection to >= 24megs, since it's not uncommon
    for dpkg to actually use 16megs of ram all on its own when using the
    largemem setting (old minimum was 16megs)
  * debian/rules: chmod -x everything in /usr/lib to make lintian happy.
    in the clean phase just rm -rf $(BUILD), we don't need to run
    distclean and all that other stuff. Don't run "make dist", we
    simply copy the .tar.gz that dpkg-source creates for the byhand
    source.
  * Make start-stop-daemon exit(1) when we don't find one of the
    pid's we are trying to kill, in accordance with the man page.
  * When running --configure on an already installed package, just
    say it's installed, and not that it is in an unconfigurable
    state
  * Fixed some compiler warnings
  * Make dpkg check for uid 0 requirement, before checking the path
    since not being root, is probably the reason that the PATH is
    borked in the first place
  * Make -p short for --print-avail, and -P short for --purge
  * Fix typo in md5sum(1) man page
  * start-stop-daemon: Add --background and --make-pidfile options
  * update-alternatives: make sure we remove "old" symlinks when they
    are no longer pertinent. Add /etc/alternatives/README that refers
    to the update-alternatives(8) man page.
  * dpkg-divert: Add check for being able to write to the old/new
    destination before doing a rename. We fail on this, without
    changing the diversion registry
  * Fix bad regex in update-rc.d

  * dselect doesn't die when you resize the terminal
  * check if a file is also in a new package before removing it when upgrading
  * offer to show a diff between the old and new conffile

    * Worked around broken textmode implementation in GPG.

  * debian/rules: add code from lesstif's debian/rules to make libtool
    less of a fool (i.e. not use -rpath and to link shared libraries
    against libraries it depends on).  Code by Richard Braakman
    <dark@xs4all.nl> and Yann Dirson <dirson@debian.org>.
  * debian/rules: remove all reference to the packaging manual as it is

  * debian/README.compile: removed gawk and bogus comment about gettext
    being in experimental, as reported by Santiago Vila <sanvila@unex.es>

    conversion (fixes #6801).
  * Renamed "programmer's manual" to 'packaging manual'.

    have been converted so far.  No translations have yet been
    constructed.
  * Handle 'libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x40010000)' format from libc6

    main and recursive).

  * floppy disk method available - NB this is a first attempt only.

  * hard disk method uses --merge-avail rather than --update-avail.

    remove a directory belonging to a package being removed.
  * dpkg, dpkg-deb usage error reporting improved.

    packages are processed at once).  (Bug#1209.)

  * dpkg --configure and --remove work better when `processing'
    several related packages with --no-act.

  * dpkg --auto is now two options, --pending or -a (for configure,

    and the -P alias for it is withdrawn.

  * dpkg --unpack/--install filenames in messages are now more sensible
    about when to use .../ (show as many trailing components as possible
    in 40 characters, or the whole path if that the last component is
    longer than that).

    once in the same run.  (Bug#1169.)

  * dpkg cosmetic fix to dependency problems message (this bug
    hasn't been triggered to my knowledge).

  * perl-dpkg no longer installed in /usr/bin.

 -- Ian Jackson <iwj10@cus.cam.ac.uk>  Wed, 2 Aug 1995 13:02:58 +0100

dpkg (0.93.64) ALPHA; priority=MEDIUM

  * dpkg marks a package as no longer `to be configured in this run'
    when an error occurs, so that other packages which depend on it
    will fail (rather than causing a loop and an assertion failure,
     packages.c:166: failed assertion `dependtry <= 4').

  * dselect initial selection granularity is single-package.
  * dpkg --no-also-select option renamed to --selected-only (old option
    still accepted, but no longer in --help).  Changed -N to -O.

  * dselect `update' option changed to `install' (and other options
    renamed too).  NB: old access methods will not work, because
    the `update' script should now be an `install' script.

  * dpkg --skip-same-version and --refuse-downgrade produce friendlier
    messages when they skip packages.
  * --licence option now properly mentioned in all programs' --version
    messages.

  * bad fix for ELF compile problem involving myopt.h removed (compile
    problem turned out to be a GCC bug.)

 -- Ian Jackson <iwj10@cus.cam.ac.uk>  Tue, 1 Aug 1995 03:03:58 +0100

dpkg (0.93.63) ALPHA; priority=LOW

  * dpkg --search now does a substring search if the string doesn't
    start with a wildcard character (*, [ or ?) or slash.

  * problem with C/C++ linkage of stuff in "myopt.h" fixed, to help
    with compiling with GCC 2.7.0.

  * dselect Makefile.in `clean' deletes curkeys.inc &c, so that they are
    not shipped in the distribution source and will be rebuilt on the
    target system.

  * Added <errno.h> to lib/lock.c and fixed ref. to `byte' in
    md5sum/md5.c, for portability to Solaris 2.

  * Rebuilt `configure' and `config.h.in' using autoconf 2.3.
  * Revised function attribute support checking in configure script.
  * Removed obsolete `dselect.pl' from scripts directory.
  * New option --licence on all the C programs.

dpkg (0.93.38) BETA; priority=MEDIUM

  * Version number comparisons (in dpkg and dselect) now >= <=
    as documented (Bug#831; thanks to Christian Linhart).

  * dselect now has a non-superuser readonly mode.
  * dselect doesn't pop up unsatisfied `Optional's when quitting.
  * `unable to delete saved old file' message fixed dpkg_tmp to dpkg-tmp.

  * Made dpkg convert `revision' to `package_revision' when reading
    (eg) the `status' file.  libdpkg.a has `revision' as a synonym
    for `package_revision' and writes the former.

  * Major improvements and many changes to C option parsing, database
    management, error handling, Makefiles &c to support dpkg.
  * dpkg-deb should now work if sizeof(void*) < sizeof(void(*)()).

 -- Ian Jackson <iwj10@cus.cam.ac.uk>  Mon, 24 Apr 1995 12:34:39 +0100

dpkg (0.93.37) BETA; priority=LOW (MEDIUM for dselect users)

  * Fixed segfault if no description available (Bug#735);
    thanks to Peter Tobias for the bug report.
  * Fixed other assorted minor bugs in description displays.

  * Changed dpkg-deb --info short option from -i to -I, to make
    it unique across dpkg and dpkg-deb (-i still works with
    dpkg-deb for backwards compatibility).

  * Produce more sensible error when main package list is empty.

 -- Ian Jackson <iwj10@cus.cam.ac.uk>  Fri, 7 Apr 1995 02:24:55 +0100

dpkg (0.93.36) BETA; priority=LOW (MEDIUM for dselect users)

  * All the C code (including dselect) updated to support `provides'
    (virtual packages).
  * Revamped dselect's related package selection/deselection
    algorithms.
  * Everything can now handle arbitrary `class' values (as well
    as the predefined ones which we understand and can interpret).
  * Fixed bug that prevented display update when moving down a small
    recursive package list in dselect.
  * Column heading characters corrected from `SHOC' to `HSOC'.

 -- Ian Jackson <iwj10@cus.cam.ac.uk>  Thu, 6 Apr 1995 12:48:13 +0100

dpkg (0.93.35) BETA; priority=MEDIUM

 * Preserve ownerships and permissions on configuration files.
 * Fix bug in conffile updating that could leave a hardlink
   <foo>.dpkg-new to the conffile <foo>.

 * Improved dselect's package list help messages.
 * Highlight now moves on after (de)selecting just one package.
 * Better algorithm for scrolling up/down when moving highlight.
 * Fixed bug in display of `preformatted' extended Description lines.
   (dselect is still ALPHA, but is fairly stable.)

 * Improved dpkg's message when configuring a package that doesn't
   exist, and when selecting or skipping a package that isn't
   currently selected (during unpack processing).

 * Description in control file expanded.

 * Scroll back to top when changing what is in the `info' area.

dpkg (0.93.34) BETA; priority=LOW (HIGH for dselect users)

 * dselect: Fixed bug which caused a coredump if you exited the
   package list if you'd made any changes.  Ouch !

 * dselect: Improved selection algorithm to show fewer extraneous
   packages; improved display for unavailable packages.

 * dpkg: Improved progress messages during unpacking somewhat.

dpkg (0.93.33) BETA; priority=LOW (HIGH for dselect users)

 * dselect now has a main menu.

 * Fixed nasty uninitialised data bug in dselect.

 * dselect now locks and unlocks the packages database.

Mon, 27 Mar 1995 03:30:51 BST  Ian Jackson <iwj10@cus.cam.ac.uk>

	* dpkg (0.93.32): Alpha dselect released and installed in
	                  /usr/sbin/dselect.
	* dpkg (0.93.32): Many portability enhancements: should now
	                  compile using GCC 2.6.3, and dpkg-deb should
	                  compile better on non-Linux systems.

	* dpkg (0.93.32): Added vercmp.c with version comparison code.
	* dpkg (0.93.32): varbufextend message changed - varbufs not
	                  just for input buffers.
	* dpkg (0.93.32): varbuf has C++ member functions in header
	                  #ifdef __cplusplus.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.31:

* start-stop-daemon --pidfile now works (Bug#571).
* Fixed dependency processing bugs which could require a rerun of
  dpkg --configure (Bug#566).
* Fixed garbage output for `language' of control file in dpkg-deb --info.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.30:

Changes in dpkg 0.93.09:

* Made postinst scripts really be run when dpkg --purge used.
* Added new --force-extractfail option - VERY DANGEROUS.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.28:

  the whole status database to become trashed when any update files
  were read.

* Make version number specifications in Depends &c work.
* Added AC_PROG_CXX to autoconf.in for dselect.
* Changed myopt.h not to have cipaction field in cmdinfo (this was
  specially for dpkg-deb) - now we have a generic void*.
* Renamed `class' member of `pkginfoperfile' to `clas' [sic].
* Much work in `dselect' subdirectory.
* Deleted executables, objects and libraries from OLD tree !
* Minor changes to various copyright notices and top-of-file comments.
* Don't install nasty Perl dselectish thing as /usr/bin/dselect.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.26:

* Added --no-also-select instead of not auto-selecting on --unpack
  but doing so on --install; removed --force-unpack-any.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.25:

* Fixed duplicate output (failure to flush before fork) bug.
* More clarification of md5sum.c copyright.
* Corrected typo in ChangeLog in 0.93.24 source package.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.24:

* dpkg could copy conffiles info from one package to another.  Aargh.
  Bug #426.
* dpkg failed to initialise status if you tried to remove or
  configure a nonexistent package.  Bug #419.
* install-info now handles START-INFO-DIR-ENTRY entries like:
   * Gdb::                         The GNU debugger.
  Previously it would only accept (Bug #407):
   * Gdb: (gdb).                   The GNU debugger.
* When installing a new foo.info[.gz], install-info now replaces
   * Foo: (foo.info).              The Gnoo Foo.
  as well as just * Foo: (foo). ...
* Moved option parsing out of dpkg-deb into libdpkg.
* Assorted minor source code rearrangements.
* Fixed assorted copyright notices, clarified md5sum copyright.
* Corrected typo in 0.93.23 source package's ChangeLog.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.23:

* `dpkg-deb' --build now does a syntax check on the control file.
* `dselect' is now no longer called `debian', spurious copy removed
  from package top-level source directory.
* C control information parsing complete and somewhat tested.
* Moved `global' include files into $(srcdir)/include from ../lib,
  added some files to the lib Makefile, and arranged for pop_cleanup().

Changes in dpkg 0.93.22:

* Fixed bug which caused dpkg to see failures of md5sum where there
  were none (would also have caused dpkg to miss a real failure).
* Fixed failure to update some `status' database fields.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.21:

* Fixed error-handling bug which could corrupt database.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.20:

* Fixed bug which ran old (/var/adm/dpkg) postinst scripts.
* Fixed dpkg usage message which claimed -i => both --install & --info.
* Use Colin Plumb's MD5 code - faster, and better copyright.
* Manpages: dpkg-deb(8), deb-control(5), deb(5) - thanks to Raul
  Deluth Miller.  Also, an xfig picture of some C program innards.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.19:

* Don't delete the `list' file from the dpkg database.
* Fixed various bugs in the conffile handling.
* Conffiles that are symlinks will now be treated as if the
  `dereferenced' name of the file was listed in conffiles.  This means
  that /etc/foo -> /usr/etc/foo will cause all conffile updates of
  /etc/foo to create /usr/etc/foo.dpkg-tmp &c instead.  However, the
  link will be removed if --purge is used to delete all the conffiles.
* When doing a new installation, or when updating a conffile that
  wasn't listed as a conffile in the old version of the package, don't
  do any prompting but just install the version from the archive.
* Corrected error message if exec of dpkg --vextract failed
  and --instroot or --root specified.
* Added new --force-unpack-any option.
* Extra newline after --status output.
* Added -W options to CFLAGS.
* Fixed mistake in previous ChangeLog entry.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.18:

* Fixed invocation of dpkg-deb --vextract if --root or --instdir
  not specified.
* Create /var/lib/dpkg/updates.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.17:

* install-info --remove exits with status 0 if it doesn't find the
  thing to remove, instead of status 1.
* Error handling functions have __attribute__((format...)) if GCC.
* push_cleanup its arg takes void **argv instead of char **argv.
* Top-level Makefile.in has set -e before `for' loops.
* dpkg-deb --info not-an-existing-file produces fewer error messages.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.16:

* Made --root= option really extract to $instroot instead of `/'.
* install-info clears the 0444 bits in its umask.
* Fixed a few database handling bugs which cause dpkg always to fail,
  and usually to corrupt the status database in various ways.
* dpkg-deb completely rewritten, now doesn't tinker with
  /var/{adm,lib}/dpkg.  Should be faster.
* Directory structure and Makefiles in source package reorganised.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.15:

* Added `debian' (dselect), still very primitive.
* Database format changed, and moved from /var/adm to /var/lib.
* Added dpkg --avail mode, --list, --status and --search.
* Set of dpkg => dpkg-deb pass-through operations changed (but
  dpkg-deb not yet updated).
* Added --root, --admindir and --instdir, as well as --isok &c.
* Moved much stuff into /usr/lib/dpkg-lib.pl, rewritten status
  database handling.
* Put packages in `purge' state even if `deinstall' requested if
  they have no postrm and no conffiles.
* Version number comparisons fixed.
* insert-version.pl now installes lib.pl filename too.
* Strip trailing slashes when reading files from file lists.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.14:

* Fixed parsing of DEPENDS &c fields with trailing whitespace.
* postinst now fixes up broken ispell.control file.
* Cyclic dependency/multiple package removal processing: don't consider
  packages we've just removed when looking for a reason not to go ahead.
* Added call to postinst with `purge' argument for expunging old
  configuration etc. that aren't listed in conffiles.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.13:

* sub S_ISREG defined in dpkg.pl.
* Checking of DEPENDS &c fields was too lax, causing an internal error
  if you fed it certain kinds of broken control file.
* Fixed misleading message from bogus installationstatus call.
* New -u and -U options to dpkg-deb which don't unpack the /DEBIAN
  directory, and use these in dpkg.pl; clean up /DEBIAN in postinst.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.12:

* No longer needs *.ph files, since these appear to be broken.
* Postinst fixes up *.control files with curly brackets.
* embryo of dselect.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.11:

* New --ignore-depends option.
* This ChangeLog changed format here.

Wed Nov 30 15:38:21 GMT 1994  Ian Jackson  <iwj10@cus.cam.ac.uk>

	* dpkg 0.93.11 released.

	* conffile updating fixed.

	* Message `updgrade' in dpkg changed to `replace'.

	* install-info now copes with multi-line entries.

	* version numbers now done automatically in dpkg and install-info.

	* more debugging around conffiles updates.

	* *.hash files not deleted so soon.

	* adds brand new packages to status array so we can install them.

	* postinst does h2ph for {sys,linux}/{stat,types}.ph if required.

Mon Nov 28 02:00:13 GMT 1994  Ian Jackson  <iwj10@cus.cam.ac.uk>

        * dpkg 0.93.10 released.

        * dpkg.pl completely rewritten.

        * dpkg-deb: removed dabase-processing and --install option.

        * Makefiles reworked, debian.rules added.

        * Don't install anything in /usr/doc/examples.

        * dpkg-*.deb contains /usr/bin/dpkg-deb.dist, fixed up by postinst.

Thu Oct 20 13:22:20 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)

        * dpkg 0.93.9 released.

        * dpkg.pl: Use $argument, not $package, with `--build'.
        Make sure that saved postinst scripts are executable.

Tue Oct 18 09:40:57 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)

        * dpkg 0.93.8 released.

        * deb/remove.c (pkg_remove): Do not report an error from rmdir ()
        when `errno' is ENOTEMPTY (Directory not empty), because in this
        case we have found the highest-level directory in the package and
        are ready to exit the loop (i.e., it is a normal occurrence).

Mon Oct 17 10:44:32 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)

        * Makefile.in: Adapted all Makefiles to the GNU Coding Standards.

        * deb/remove.c (pkg_remove): Make sure that parent directories are
        removed LAST!  This will result in complete removal of packages
        when --remove is called.  dpkg 0.93.7 (and earlier) had problems
        with this because it tried to remove directories in order, which
        will work most of the time, but not necessarily all of the time.

        * deb/list.c (pkg_list): Output is sorted by package name.

Tue Oct  4 12:27:10 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)

        * deb/contents.c (pkg_contents): When a list file cannot be
        opened, silently fail and let the front-end explain the problem.

        * deb/util.c (return_info): When a control file cannot be opened,
        silently fail and let the front-end explain the problem.

        * deb/search.c (pkg_search): Exit 0 if the regular expression is
        matched and 1 if it is not.

Mon Oct  3 18:38:53 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)

        * dpkg.pl: New file.  Replaces dpkg.sh.

        * deb/Makefile.in: Renamed `dpkg-util.deb' to `dpkg-deb'.

        * deb/build.c (pkg_build): `--build' is less verbose, instead
        letting the front-end add verbosity where appropriate.

        * deb/install.c (pkg_install): Ditto.

        * deb/remove.c (pkg_remove): Ditto.

        * deb/search.c (pkg_search): Ditto.

        * deb/describe.c (pkg_describe): `--describe' is less verbose,
        instead letting the front-end add verbosity where appropriate.
        The ``Description:'' label has been removed.

        * deb/version.c (pkg_version): `--version' is less verbose,
        instead letting the front-end add verbosity where appropriate.
        The ``Version:'' label has been removed, as has the maintainer
        information.

Mon Sep 12 14:22:04 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)

        * deb/version.c (pkg_version): `--version' now reports the
        version number of dpkg if no argument is specified.

Thu Sep  1 13:31:37 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)

        * dpkg 0.93.7 released.

        * deb/build.c (pkg_build): check status and exit if non-zero.

        * deb/contents.c (pkg_contents): ditto.

        * deb/install.c (archive_extract): ditto.

Thu Sep  1 13:20:08 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)

        * deb/version.c (pkg_version): indent to the same point as
        pkg_describe.

Thu Sep  1 12:21:11 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)

        * Makefile.in (dist): added debian.rules binary, source and
        dist targets to make final distribution easier to make.
        (install): install programs to /usr/bin.

        * deb/Makefile.in (install): install programs to /usr/bin.

        * deb/list.c (pkg_list): enforce a maximum limit of ten characters
        for the package name in the output.
        (pkg_list): left-justify the version number to make it easier for
        the front-end to parse the output.
        (pkg_list): replace first '\n' character in packages[n].description
        with '\0'.

        * deb/install.c (archive_extract): use the `p' option to `tar' to
        ensure that permissions are preserved.

Sat Aug 27 09:53:37 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)

        * dpkg 0.93.6 released.

        * deb/util.c (return_info): only unlink CONTROL if ARCHIVE_FLAG is
        true!

Fri Aug 26 15:38:22 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)

        * dpkg 0.93.5 released.

        * deb/contents.c (pkg_contents): merged function archive_contents
        into function pkg_contents.

        * deb/contents.c (pkg_contents): use lstat (rather than stat) so
        that symbolic links are recognized.
        (pkg_contents): print the usual `<path> -> <link_to>' now that we
        recognize symbolic links.

        * deb/util.c (return_info): create a FIFO to pipe the needed
        information to the ``formatter'' rather than creating a directory
        in /tmp for the package information, which is what we used to do.

Thu Aug 25 11:46:27 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)

        * lib/fake-ls.c (mk_date_string): return a pointer to malloc'ed
        area.
        (mk_mode_string): ditto.

        * dpkg.sh: make sure the control information is extracted to a
        uniquely-named temporary directory during package installation.

        * dpkg.sh: execute the pre- and post-removal scripts during
        package removal.

        * dpkg.sh: exit immediately if dpkg-util.deb reports failure.

        * deb/install.c (pkg_control): make sure that `package' exists and
        is a Debian archive before doing anything.

        * deb/install.c (pkg_extract): make sure that `package' exists and
        is a Debian archive before doing anything.

        * deb/install.c (pkg_install): unlink `extract_output' when done.

        * deb/remove.c (pkg_remove): use lstat (rather than stat) so that
        --remove does not get confused and think that a symbolic link to a
        directory is actually a directory, which results in the symbolic
        link never being removed at all.

ChangeLog begins Thu Aug 25 11:46:27 1994 for dpkg 0.93.5.
