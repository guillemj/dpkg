deb-prerm - package pre-removal maintainer script

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<DEBIAN/prerm>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A package can perform several pre-removal actions via maintainer
scripts, by including an executable I<prerm> file in its control
archive (i.e. I<DEBIAN/prerm> during package creation).

The script can be called in the following ways:

=over

=item I<prerm> B<remove>

Before the package is removed.

=item I<old-prerm> B<upgrade> I<new-version>

Before an upgrade.

=item I<new-prerm> B<failed-upgrade> I<old-version> I<new-version>

If the above B<upgrade> fails.

The I<new-version> is passed only since dpkg 1.18.5.

=item I<prerm> B<deconfigure> B<in-favour> I<new-package> I<new-version>

=item S<    >[ B<removing> I<old-package> I<old-version> ]

Before package is deconfigured while dependency is replaced due to conflict.

=item I<prerm> B<remove> B<in-favour> I<new-package> I<new-version>
