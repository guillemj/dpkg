Installation from a directory on the filesystem.

The area you are installing from should contain the Packages.gz file
from each distribution area being installed (usually main and optionally
contrib and non-free) as well as the corresponding binary/*/*.deb files.

The easiest way to do get this is to make a (partial) copy of the
distribution site's directory hierarchy, if possible.
