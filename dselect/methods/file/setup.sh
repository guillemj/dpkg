Cannot find the $1 'Packages' file. The information in the

If you overlooked it when downloading you should do get it now and
return to this installation procedure when you have done so: you will
find one Packages file and one Packages.gz file -- either will do --
in the 'binary-$iarch' subdirectory of each area on the FTP sites and
CD-ROMs. Alternatively (and this will be rather slow) the packages in
the distribution area can be scanned - say 'scan' if you want to do so.

you wish to install.
