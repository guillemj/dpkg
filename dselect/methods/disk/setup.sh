Cannot find the $1 'Packages' file. The information in the

installations, and is very useful for upgrades.

If you overlooked it when downloading you should do get it now and
return to this installation procedure when you have done so: you will
find one Packages file and one Packages.gz file -- either will do --
in the 'binary-$iarch' subdirectory of each area on the FTP sites and
CD-ROMs. Alternatively (and this will be rather slow) the packages in
the distribution area can be scanned - say 'scan' if you want to do so.

You need a separate Packages file from each of the distribution areas
you wish to install.
