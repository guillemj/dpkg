mark packages for installation (using '+') or deinstallation (using '-').\n\
Packages can be marked either singly or in groups; initially you will see that\n\
the line 'All packages' is selected.  '+', '-' and so on will affect all the\n\
packages described by the highlighted line.\n\n\

given a sub-list of the relevant packages, so that you can solve the problems.\n\n\

Much on-line help is available, please make use of it - press '?' at\n\
any time for help.\n\n\

that, the package descriptions and the internal control information.\n\n\

this sub-list have been set to match those, so you can just hit Return to\n\

the problem(s), and go back to the main list, by pressing capital 'X'.\n\n\

You can also move around the list and change the markings so that they are more\n\
like what you want, and you can 'reject' my suggestions by using the capital\n\
